        //   - API 35+ forces edge-to-edge (content draws behind the system bars). No layout change was
        //     needed here, because BaseActivity already runs every screen in IMMERSIVE_STICKY with
        //     both bars hidden (isFullScreen defaults to true and onWindowFocusChanged re-applies
        //     hideSystemUI on every focus gain), so there are no visible system bars to inset against
        //     and getRootWindowInsets() reports zero for systemBars() once they're hidden. Verified by
        //     comparing button bounds before/after the bump: identical. Do NOT add system-bar inset
        //     padding here — an earlier attempt did, and it briefly applied real insets on the first
        //     dispatch (top=80/bottom=144) before hideSystemUI zeroed them, i.e. a visible jump for
        //     no benefit. If the app ever stops hiding the bars, that padding becomes necessary.
        //   - API 36 turns on predictive back. The app already routes Back through AndroidX
        //     OnBackPressedCallback (MapActivity's aiming/search cancel, BaseActivity's
        //     double-back-to-exit), which is the predictive-back-compatible API.
