/**
 * Downloads the pre-built map db for whichever planet-tiling "box" contains a given location (see
 * {@link BoxManifest}, built by {@code tools/build_global_cluster_dbs.py} and hosted at
 * {@code https://wikiponder.com/navia/global_boxes/}) and merges it into the app's own db — optionally
 * together with every box bordering it too (not capped at 4 — see {@link BoxManifest#findNeighbors};
 * the download screen's "larger map" option), so a user near the edge of one box isn't left with a
 * hard border a short walk away.
 *
 * <p>This is now the *only* way TouchMap downloads map data — there is no more per-country Geofabrik
 * PBF picker and no Overpass radius fallback. A box db is schema-identical to the app's own
 * {@code osm.db} (same {@code nodes}/{@code ways}/{@code way_cells}/{@code way_regions}/{@code regions}
 * tables — see {@code OSMDatabaseHelper.onCreate} and the box tool's own docstring), and every
 * feature in it is already tagged {@code region = OSMDatabaseHelper.REGION_WORLD} (the box tool does
 * no per-feature admin-region resolution), so merging is a straight bulk copy: {@code ATTACH} the
 * downloaded db and run {@code INSERT OR IGNORE INTO main.X SELECT * FROM box.X} for
 * {@code nodes}/{@code ways}/{@code way_cells}/{@code way_regions} — no per-row parsing, no
 * region-id remapping, and (per the box tool's docs) a way that touches more than one box always
 * carries its full, identical geometry in each one, so a way shared by two already-downloaded boxes
 * is a harmless duplicate `INSERT OR IGNORE`, never a partial/clipped merge. {@code regions} is
 * deliberately excluded from this copy — see {@link #mergeIntoAppDb}.
 *
 * <p>Pipeline (repeated per box when downloading neighbors too, always primary box first — see
 * {@link #importForLocation}): resolve the box(es) from the manifest -> download each
 * {@code .db.gz} -> gunzip -> attach + bulk-copy into the app db -> record it as imported (see
 * {@link OSMDatabaseHelper#markBoxImported}, which replaced the old Geofabrik-boundary-based
 * "imported_at" tracking — a box is a plain rectangle, not an admin polygon). A box's data is
 * merged and marked as soon as ITS OWN pipeline finishes, independent of every other box in the
 * run, so cancelling partway through a multi-box download (see {@link #cancel}) still leaves
 * whichever boxes already finished fully usable — nothing is rolled back.
 *
 * <p><b>Progress percent</b> is one continuous 0-100 across the WHOLE run (every box, every phase),
 * not a per-phase-per-box cycle: each box is weighted by its known download size ({@code gzSizeMb},
 * already in the manifest before any downloading starts — see {@link #importForLocation}), and
 * within a box the connect/download/extract/save phases are weighted {@link #DOWNLOAD_FRACTION}/
 * {@link #EXTRACT_FRACTION}/{@link #SAVE_FRACTION} of that box's share. See {@link #reportOverall}.
